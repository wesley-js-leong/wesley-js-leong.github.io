# Hi! I'm Wesley. My pronouns are he/him/his.

### I am a Psychology PhD student in the [Language and Cognition](https://langcog.psychology.uconn.edu/) program at the University of Connecticut, advised by [Gerry Altmann](https://altmann.lab.uconn.edu/). I work on topics at the intersection of neuroscience, computation, and language, and am currently interested in how the brain represents participants in a story over time.

Previously, I was a research engineer at [Halo Neuroscience](https://www.haloneuro.com/) in San Francisco. There, I used a combination of behavioral and neuroimaging methods to study the effects of transcranial electrical stimulation on human performance. I also wrote Python code for research uses such as experiment presentation, data analysis, and deep learning.

Before that, I graduated from New York University with a BS in Neuroscience. My thesis was on cerebellar time perception, which I wrote while in [Eric Lang's Lab](https://ericlanglab.weebly.com/). I also did some work in linguistics, including an MEG study in the [Neurolinguistics Lab](https://wp.nyu.edu/neurolinglab/) and a [funded project](http://journals.ed.ac.uk/lifespansstyles/article/view/5642) on tense variation in Singapore English.

On a related note, I am from the tiny island nation of [Singapore](https://www.tripzilla.com/singapore-worlds-best-city-for-street-food).
